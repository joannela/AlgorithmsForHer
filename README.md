## Using Hydra

It is possible to use Hydra in the [browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) or [locally](https://github.com/ojack/atom-hydra) on your machine. In this workshop we will be using Hydra in the browser. Hydra works best and has more functionality in [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) (sorry!). If you would like to be able to use the Desktop capture feature please follow these instructions
* Download [this file](https://github.com/ojack/hydra/tree/master/screen-capture-extension/extension) off Github and save it in a place you remember.
* Navigate to chrome://extensions in the Chrome browser.
* Click "Load unpacked" at the top left hand side of the screen.
* Navigate to the extensions folder
