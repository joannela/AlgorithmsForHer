## Using Hydra

It is possible to use Hydra in the [browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) or [locally](https://github.com/ojack/atom-hydra) on your machine. In this workshop we will be using Hydra in the browser. Hydra works best and has more functionality in [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) (sorry!). If you would like to be able to use the Desktop capture feature please follow these instructions
* Navigate to [this](https://github.com/ojack/hydra) Github page.
* Select the (green) 'Clone or download' button at the top right. 
* Select download as zip.
* Navigate to the 'hydra-master.zip' file and un-zip it. 
* In the Chrome browser navigate to chrome://extensions.
* Click "Load unpacked" at the top left hand side of the screen.
* Navigate to: hydra-master/screen-capture-extension.  
* Click on the extensions folder so it is highlighted and hit 'Select'.
* Restart the Chrome browser.
